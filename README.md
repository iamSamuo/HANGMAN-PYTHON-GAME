# HANMAN-PYTHON-GAME
While practicing coding in python, i made a word letter guessing game.
This game choses a word from a list of words, converts the words into a set of letters. Takes User input guessed letter, then stores it a variable.
If the user guessed the correct letter present in the word, the user is prompted to input another letter, 
if the next  letter is already guessed, the user is notified and asked to guess again. The user can only guess the letters of the word six times.
If the the trials end, the user receives a "You have died" message on the screen.
